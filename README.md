What's the Weather Like?

[WeatherPy]
After generating 500+ random using random latitudes and longitudes and finding the nearest cities using citipy,
I created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Then I split the latitudes to form northern and southern hemisphere dataframes and ran regression analysis for each of the relationships above.
An explanition of the correlation found for each chart can be found above the code for the regression analysis. 
the cities were outputed to a csv file as well as images of the plots. 

VacationPy
After creating a heatmap plotting the humidity of each city analyzed. The data was parsed using fair weather paramiters. The nearest hotel within in 5000 meters was then found and plotted on top of the humidity heat map.
